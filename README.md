## Description
Create a Web app hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that emulates IMDB to provide useful information about some topic.

The project must meet several criteria.

must be unique, first come, first served
must have at least two data sources that can be programmatically scraped using a RESTful API
must have at least four models
each model must have at least five attributes
each model must be connected to at least two other models
every instance of each model must have some kind of multimedia (i.e. image or video)
every instance of each model must be rich with different content (e.g. descriptions, feeds, maps, multimedia (above), etc.)
This is a group project with four phases and only one PUBLIC repo will be used across all phases.

The Web app must meet several criteria.

A RESTful API must be documented using Apiary.
The GUI must be implemented using Bootstrap.
The frontend must be implemented using JavaScript and React.
The backend must be implemented using Python and Flask.
The website must use a URL provided by Namecheap.
The group must collaborate using Apiary and it must be integrated with the GitHub repo.
The group must collaborate using Slack and it must be integrated with the GitHub repo.
The group must collaborate using Trello and it must be integrated with the GitHub repo.
For the purposes of grading, do not change the production website between the time that you submit it and the time that it is graded.

## Groups
The groups have been set up on Canvas.

Pick a project leader for the group.

There will be a different project leader for each phase.

A group member can only be project leader once.

## Submission
Below, GitHubID is always that of the owner of the repo.

## Repos
These are the URLs involved:

GitHub public code repo: https://github.com/GitHubID/idb/
UT Box: https://utexas.app.box.com
